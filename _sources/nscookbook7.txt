NEMOSIM - Cook book (7) 
=======================

Working with non-NEMO output
----------------------------

Although intended for use with NEMO output there is little to prevent ``nemosim`` being
used with any other gridded dataset that represents geospatial data. The main requirements
that need to be met are:

 * Easily identified dimension variables that can be used to determine the
   size of the input data field
 * Data coordinates that can be described by two-dimensional longitude and latitude 
   fields and 
 * All data can be read from netcdf files. 

It is often possible to satisfy these requirements with minimal manipulation of input
data. Converting other data formats into netCDF will not be covered here but there are
plenty of internet resources dedicated to the subject. Suggestions for ensuring the first
two criteria can be met will be presented using an example dataset obtained from a
near-global configuration of WaveWatch III (WW-III)

Firstly, lets examine the raw data file:: 

   ncdump -h ./data/hs_197903.nc
   netcdf hs_197903 {
   dimensions:
   	time = UNLIMITED ; // (1 currently)
   	latitude = 344 ;
   	longitude = 512 ;
   variables:
   	short hs(time, latitude, longitude) ;
   		hs:long_name = "significant_wave_height" ;
   		hs:standard_name = "significant_height_of_wind_and_swell_waves" ;
   		hs:units = "m" ;
   		hs:_FillValue = -32767s ;
   		hs:scale_factor = 0.002f ;
   		hs:add_offset = 0.f ;
   		hs:valid_min = 0 ;
   		hs:valid_max = 32000 ;
   	float latitude(latitude) ;
   		latitude:units = "degree_north" ;
   		latitude:long_name = "latitude" ;
   		latitude:standard_name = "latitude" ;
   		latitude:valid_min = -90.f ;
   		latitude:valid_max = 90.f ;
   		latitude:axis = "Y" ;
   	float longitude(longitude) ;
   		longitude:units = "degree_east" ;
   		longitude:long_name = "longitude" ;
   		longitude:standard_name = "longitude" ;
   		longitude:valid_min = -180.f ;
   		longitude:valid_max = 180.f ;
   		longitude:axis = "X" ;
   	double time(time) ;
   		time:long_name = "julian day (UT)" ;
   		time:standard_name = "time" ;
   		time:units = "days since 1990-01-01T00:00:00Z" ;
   		time:conventions = "relative julian days with decimal part (as parts of the day )" ;
   		time:axis = "T" ;
   
   // global attributes:
   		:product_name = "197903.nc" ;
   		:area = "*** SMC 50k Global Model ***" ;
   		:latitude_resolution = "   0.4687500" ;
   		:longitude_resolution = "   0.7031250" ;
   		:southernmost_latitude = "-78.0468750" ;
   		:northernmost_latitude = "82.7343750" ;
   		:westernmost_longitude = "0.3515630" ;
   		:easternmost_longitude = "359.6484375" ;
   		:minimum_altitude = "-12000 m" ;
   		:maximum_altitude = "9000 m" ;
   		:altitude_resolution = "n/a" ;
   		:start_date = "1979-03-01T00:00:00Z" ;
   		:stop_date = "1979-03-31T23:00:00Z" ;
   		:history = "Thu Feb 23 17:02:16 2017: ncks -v hs -d time,0,0,1 197903.nc hs_197903.nc\n",
   			"" ;
   		:NCO = "\"4.5.5\"" ;
   }

This meets the first criterion since the longitude and latitude dimensions clearly specify
the size of the 2-dimensional field to be imaged. By default, ``nemosim`` expects these
dimension variables to be named 'x' and 'y' so without further input, ``nemosim`` will be
unable to identify the correct dimensions::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o nocoord.png -nomask
    NetCDF: Invalid dimension ID or name
   STOP Stopped

This first hurdle can be overcome by explicitly naming the dimension variables using the ``-xdim``
and ``-ydim`` options. E.g.::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o nocoord.png -nomask -xdim longitude -ydim latitude
    Error: need both nav_lon and nav_lat fields to proceed.
    Processing terminated

The problem now is that ``nemosim`` expects the 2-dimensional arrays containing the coordinate data to be
named nav_lon and nav_lat and to be available in the main dataset. In the current case, the data does
not contain 2-d coordinate fields since the grid is regular and described by two 1-d arrays. 

We can overcome this restriction by taking advantage of ``nemosim``'s tiered approach to
locating the coordinate fields. The 2-dimensional fields expected are always named
'nav_lon' and 'nav_lat' but these may be extracted from any of three possible sources:

 * The main dataset named by the ``-f`` option (default)
 * The bathymetry file as named by the ``-bathy`` option (or NEMOBATHYFILE environment variable)
   (iThe selection of coordinates from the bathymetry file is activated by the ``-bcoord`` option)
 * A named coordinate dataset as specified by the ``-coordf`` option

Creating an external coordinate file
------------------------------------

The previous command did not name a bathymetry or coordinate file and failed to find the
required nav_lon and nav_lat fields in the main dataset. The easiest solution, which avoids changing
the source data is to construct 2-d coordinate fields in a separate file and provide this to
``nemosim``. A short python script is as good a way as any to achieve this::

   cat navadd.py
   from netCDF4 import Dataset
   import numpy as np
   import sys
   
   pathin =  sys.argv[1]
   pathout =  sys.argv[2]
   
   fw = Dataset(pathin)
   hs = fw.variables['hs'][:,:,:]
   lon = fw.variables['longitude'][:]
   lat = fw.variables['latitude'][:]
   fw.close()
   
   nx = hs.shape[2]
   ny = hs.shape[1]
   
   nav_lon = np.zeros((ny,nx))
   nav_lat = np.zeros((ny,nx))
   for nnx in range(nx):
     for nny in range(ny):
       nav_lon[nny,nnx] = lon[nnx]
       nav_lat[nny,nnx] = lat[nny]
   
   pathstart = pathout
   fo = Dataset(pathstart, 'w', format='NETCDF4')
   nxo = fo.createDimension('x', nx)
   nyo = fo.createDimension('y', ny)
   lono = fo.createVariable('nav_lon', 'f4',('y','x'))
   lato = fo.createVariable('nav_lat', 'f4',('y','x'))
   
   lono[:,:] = nav_lon
   lono.long_name = 'longitude'
   lono.standard_name = 'longitude'
   lono.units = 'degrees_east'
   #
   lato[:,:] = nav_lat
   lato.long_name = 'latitude'
   lato.standard_name = 'latitude'
   lato.units = 'degrees_north'
   #
   fo.close()
   
Such a script can be used (i.e. python2.7 navadd.py ./data/hs_197903.nc navout.nc) to
produce a navout.nc file containing::

   ncdump -h navout.nc
   netcdf navout {
   dimensions:
   	x = 512 ;
   	y = 344 ;
   variables:
   	float nav_lon(y, x) ;
   		nav_lon:long_name = "longitude" ;
   		nav_lon:standard_name = "longitude" ;
   		nav_lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
   	float nav_lat(y, x) ;
   		nav_lat:long_name = "latitude" ;
   		nav_lat:standard_name = "latitude" ;
   		nav_lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
   }

Using the external coordinate file
----------------------------------

Now armed with this external coordinate field the first image can be produced::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o example18a.png -nomask \
             -xdim longitude -ydim latitude -coordf navout.nc

.. autoimage:: example18a
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50

There are still some issues with this image. Firstly lets apply a better mask which will
remove the large negative values assigned as a FillValue from the data range calculation.
This can be done by declaring the undefined value using the ``-vmask`` option::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o example18b.png -nomask \
             -xdim longitude -ydim latitude -coordf navout.nc -vmask -32767 0.0

.. autoimage:: example18b
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50

This still isn't ideal because the FillValue here is used both for land (masked) points
and missing data points where wave heights are not available in ice covered regions. Ways
of creating a distinction between these regions will be explored later but a more worrying
issue at the Greenwich Meridion needs addressing next.

Dealing with overlap rows and columns
-------------------------------------

The odd behaviour at the Greenwich Meridion arises because of another assumption that
``nemosim`` has made about the dataset provided. That is, a global dataset is assumed to
have two overlap columns in the longitudinal direction such that::

   array(1 ,:) = array(nx-1,:)
   array(nx,:) = array(2   ,:)

where nx is the length of the longitudinal dimension. There is also an assumption that the
northern most row is folded in an ORCA-style tripolar grid fashion but that is not evident
here since the wave model does not cover the northern section of the Arctic basin. With
the example wave data, the longitudinal coverage is a complete 360 degrees but without the
overlap columns. An option, ``-nooverl``, is provided for this case which adds the
expected columns and populates them with duplicated data so that ``nemosim``'s standard
mapping algorithms will work correctly.::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o example18c.png -nomask \
             -xdim longitude -ydim latitude -coordf navout.nc -vmask -32767 0.0 \
             -nooverl

.. autoimage:: example18c
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50

Creating a mask file
--------------------

To distinguish between the land points and missing data regions it will be necessary to
introduce a land mask.  In this case a simple land mask can be derived from the depth field
which WW-III outputs with large negative values over land::

   ncap2 -s "Bathy_level=Depth; where(Bathy_level > 0) Bathy_level = 1; elsewhere Bathy_level = 0" \
             Depth.nc Bathy.nc

and this mask can be applied instead of defining the fillvalue::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o example18d.png   \
             -xdim longitude -ydim latitude -coordf navout.nc \
             -nooverl -bathy ./data/Bathy.nc

The result certainly distinguishes the missing data regions:

.. autoimage:: example18d
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50

but this is a fortunate consequence of the missing data regions having a large negative
value which has skewed the colourscale such that no blues occur in the valid data areas.
To take control over the colour assigned to the missing data region is going to require
creative use of the overlay functionality.

Using an overlay to distinguish regions
---------------------------------------

The problem here is that a single FillValue has been used for both land and missing data
regions and ``nemosim`` can't employ a bathymetry mask and a missing value mask at the
same time. We can, however, use the land mask as an overlay dataset to create the
impression of distinct Fillvalues. To do this we require the inverse of the land mask
(i.e. 1 over land, 0 over ocean) and a two tone palette which is white in its lower half
and black in the upper half (twotone.pal). Creating the inverse mask is a simple variation
on the earlier command::

   ncap2 -s "Bathy_level=Depth; where(Bathy_level > 0) Bathy_level = 0; elsewhere Bathy_level = 1" \
             Depth.nc Bathy2.nc

Now we can re-instate the FillValue, this time as the second vmask entry to provide a gray
fill, and employ the inverse mask as an overlay. Also, for good measure, define the image
size to give a 2:1 aspect ratio::

   ./nemosim -f ./data/hs_197903.nc -d hs -o example18e.png -nomask  \
             -xdim longitude -ydim latitude -coordf navout.nc -vmask -50.0 -32767 \
             -nooverl -f2 ./data/Bathy2.nc -d2 Bathy_level -limits2 0.25 0.75 \
             -overlay -cs2 twotone.pal -r 800 400

Note The first vmask entry is set to -50. to avoid any danger of valid data points being
mistaken as land points. Note also, the limits on the overlaid data are chosen to ensure
that all points with zero value will be assigned the first colour from the palette which
will be transparent in the overlay. All points set to one will be set to the final colour
(in this case black).

.. autoimage:: example18e
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50


Adding texture to land areas
----------------------------

As a final dressing it is often useful to provide more detail over land areas. This isn't
needed for scientific purposes but can give a more familiar 'atlas-style' appearance to
images used for public outreach purposes. ``nemosim`` supports this requirement by
providing the ``-transp_bg`` option which makes any pixels with the background colour
transparent. Note that the output image format must support transparency for this to be
effective; currently that limits the output format choice to png (the default). Here is an
example of this in action::

   ./nemosim -as example18e.png -o example18f.png  \
             -transp_bg -dateclk 24 453 187 01031979

where a date clock has also been added for good measure. Depending on your browser, the
apparent effect has probably been to turn the land areas white but they are, in fact,
transparent allowing the browser background colour to show through:

.. autoimage:: example18f
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50

Now all that is needed is to prepare a separate image from a suitable global topography
dataset which shows the orography over land. The land relief should be shown in a colour
range that is not prevalent in the oceanic data colour-scale; the image size and aspect
ratio must match and the longitude of the lefthand edges should match so that the land
masses align. This last point is sometimes easier to achieve after producing a base image
by using the ``-roll`` option of the ``ImageMagick`` utility: ``mogrify``. In fact, for
this purpose I keep a base image at the highest resolution that I am likely to use
(2048x1024) and rescale and roll a copy to fit as needed. For example::

    cp gebcolike_2048.png gebcolike_sm.png
    mogrify -resize 800x400 gebcolike_sm.png
    mogrify -roll +69+0 gebcolike_sm.png

which produces:

.. autoimage:: gebcolike_sm
    :scale-html: 50
    :scale-latex: 50

Note this image has been especially prepared for the WW-III data with ivory coloured
regions in the polar regions that the wave model does not cover and a black circle in the
date clock location. Compositing the two images together produces the final image::

   composite example18f.png ./doc/figs/gebcolike_sm.png example18g.png

.. autoimage:: example18g
    :scale-html: 75
    :scale-latex: 75
